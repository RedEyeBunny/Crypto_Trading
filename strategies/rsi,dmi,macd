Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Setup:** 
   - Use a trading chart with a timeframe suitable for your trading style (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, daily).
   - Apply the RSI (14-period), DMI (14-period), and MACD (12, 26, 9) indicators to the chart.

2. **Identify Trend Direction:**
   - Use the DMI to determine the trend direction. If the +DI line is above the -DI line, it suggests an uptrend, and if the -DI line is above the +DI line, it suggests a downtrend.

3. **RSI Confirmation:**
   - Wait for the RSI to signal overbought or oversold conditions. Typically, an RSI reading above 70 indicates overbought, while a reading below 30 indicates oversold.
   - For uptrends, look for RSI to become overbought as the price reaches a resistance level.
   - For downtrends, look for RSI to become oversold as the price reaches a support level.

4. **MACD Confirmation:**
   - Use the MACD to confirm potential trend reversals or continuations. Look for bullish MACD crosses (when the MACD line crosses above the signal line) for potential buy signals and bearish MACD crosses (when the MACD line crosses below the signal line) for potential sell signals.

5. **Entry and Exit Signals:**
   - **Buy Signal:** 
     - Confirm an uptrend with +DI above -DI in DMI.
     - Wait for RSI to become oversold (below 30).
     - Look for a bullish crossover on the MACD.
     - Enter a long position when all conditions are met.
   - **Sell Signal:**
     - Confirm a downtrend with -DI above +DI in DMI.
     - Wait for RSI to become overbought (above 70).
     - Look for a bearish crossover on the MACD.
     - Enter a short position when all conditions are met.

6. **Risk Management:**
   - Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
   - Consider using trailing stop-loss orders to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.
   - Determine your risk-reward ratio before entering a trade.

7. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the trade closely and be prepared to adjust your strategy based on changing market conditions.
   - Regularly review your trading plan and performance to identify areas for improvement.
